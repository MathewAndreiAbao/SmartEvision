# Smart E-VISION: Technical Documentation
**Educational Supervision & Archiving System**

## 1. System Architecture
Smart E-VISION is built on a modern **SvelteKit** frontend with a **Supabase** backend, utilizing an **Offline-First** architecture.

### core Stack
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit 5 (Runes), TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage, Realtime)
- **Local Storage**: IndexedDB (via idb-keyval)
- **Processing**: Tesseract.js (OCR), pdf-lib (QR Stamping), browser-image-compression

## 2. Database Schema

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `profiles` | User profiles with role-based access levels (Teacher, Supervisor, etc.) |

### Environment Variables (.env)
- `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase Project URL.
- `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase Anon Public Key.

### Build Command
```bash
npm run build
# The adapter-auto will automatically detect Vercel/Netlify environments.
```

### PWA Readiness
- Manifest: `/static/manifest.json`
- Service Worker: `/src/service-worker.ts`
- Ensure HTTPS is forced on the production domain for PWA features (Camera, Cache API) to function.
